## IDE Configuration

If you are going to use an IDE in order to program in Rust, you'll have different options for code highlightings, language server, and so on

- VS Code  
    You can follow the [official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_2-install-the-rustanalyzer-extension) to install the rust-analyzer extension and work with the IDE from Redmond 
- Intellij/ Clion   
    You can install this [plugin](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
- Nvim  
    Good luck (it's also the best and most lightweight option) ;)
